# Key_Logger_Project

A Key Logger project is a software application or script designed to capture and record the keystrokes made by a user on a computer or mobile device. This type of application is often used for various purposes, including user behavior analysis, security monitoring, or for malicious intent (such as stealing sensitive data like passwords). Keylogging can be done using various programming languages and frameworks, but it is essential to note that building or deploying a keylogger for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.

For educational purposes, a keylogger project can help you understand how keyboard events are captured and processed within an application, but it is crucial to always respect privacy, ethics, and legal boundaries.

Key Logger Project Overview (Educational Version):
Purpose:
Learning Tool: To understand how keyboard events work in programming and practice event handling.
User Behavior Analysis: A keylogger can be used in a controlled, ethical manner to analyze user input patterns (e.g., for accessibility features, testing applications, etc.).
Security Monitoring: For monitoring and auditing the actions of authorized users, such as administrators monitoring employees (always with informed consent and within the bounds of legal regulations).
Key Features of a Key Logger (Educational Version):
Capture Keystrokes: Capture each key the user presses on their keyboard, and log this data.
Store Key Presses: Store the logged keystrokes either locally (in a file or database) or in a server for analysis.
Display Keystrokes: Optionally, display the captured keystrokes on a simple user interface, showing real-time input as it is captured.
Export Data: Provide a way to export the captured data, usually to a text file for later analysis (often for debugging purposes in educational or testing environments).
Event Handling: Handle various keyboard events like keydown, keypress, and keyup to ensure accurate capture of inputs.
Optional Features:
Capture Special Keys: Including Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Function keys.
Detect Long Presses or Sequence of Keys: Record sequences or long presses for pattern recognition.
